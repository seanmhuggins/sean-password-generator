# sean-password-generator
DESCRIPTION:
    In this challenge I created a password generator that produces a random password. To do so, I asked multiple questions regarding the different attributes the user would like to include in their password. These questions included password length, and wether the user wanted to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, symbols, and numbers.
